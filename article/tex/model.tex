The \textbf{Standard Normal}~\footnote{See Claim~\ref{clm:example}.} distribution has density function \( \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \textcolor{blue}{e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}} \) (the \textcolor{blue}{kernel} is highlighted) and distribution function
\[
	\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-\frac{s^2}{2}}ds.
